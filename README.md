Fun with tfdf library 

Welcome to the TensorFlow Decision Forests repository! Here, you will find small projects showcasing my exploration of the TensorFlow Decision Forests (TF-DF) library. TF-DF is a powerful tool for training, running and interpreting decision forest models such as Random Forests and Gradient Boosted Trees. The library supports a wide range of tasks, including classification, regression, ranking, and uplifting. With its cutting-edge capabilities, TF-DF is a must-have tool.
